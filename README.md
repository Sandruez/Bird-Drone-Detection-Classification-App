# Bird-Drone-Detection-Classification-App
A lightweight, real-time application built with Streamlit and a fine-tuned deep learning model to detect and classify objects as Bird or Drone from images. The app uses YOLOv8 for object detection and a MobileNetV2/MobileNetB0-based classifier (.keras model) for accurate classification.
